# Hours Tracker
 
This is a simple Project created to track your hours over multiple projects. It stores all of the data in a .psf file while is plain text and easy to modify if you need to edit a field. I wanted to create something that I could use to track my time across projects efficiently, while also not requiring myself to have the program open at all times. It really is only meant for use by one user, and it is made with a windows forms template so I don't believe it has much compadibility with Mac and Linux.
